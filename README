# Movie Recommender

At a high-level, our project is a movie recommender that takes in a movie as the query and returns the top 5 similar movies. Consider the following scenario: you’ve just finished an amazing movie, something outside of your typical movie-watching wheelhouse, that has left you wanting more. Unfortunately, since you’re breaking into a new genre, your current streaming services fail to provide you with good suggestions similar to this new movie. Existing recommendation systems can prove to be inadequate since they rely on user preferences and data such as genre, cast, and director. These recommendations often fail to capture the essence of the original movie’s plot and tend to be only loosely related. They often fail to suggest movies in genres that don't fit the current user profile. The motivation for our movie recommender stems from the universal feeling of wanting more after you finish a great movie. Rather than looking at secondary predictors of movie similarity, our system analyzes the Wikipedia plot of the query to find closely related movies, while also considering factors like genre, release year, cast, and director.
